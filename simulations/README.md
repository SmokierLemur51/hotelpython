# simulations

Simulations will be for testing the hotelpython application. Automating the creation of customers and companies to booking with us.

I think that without this part of the application its a very barebones representation of my skillset and ability to learn. I created hotel python 1/04/2024 and didn't really have any idea of where to start with this.
