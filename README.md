# hotelpython

Applied for an entry level python position, creaed this project to demonstrate my current python understanding.


Hotel python is a booking service for a fictional hotel chain. It has three different parts: public, portal, and employee. 

#### Public 
This is what customers see, it tis how they will book rooms, view events we are hosting, and (if its a company or coorporation that deals with a lot of travel), they can request bulk booking discounts and also speak to our staff about booking events.


#### Employee
Non authenticated users will be directed to the hiring/login page.

 Authenticated employee users will be able to see the schedule, request shifts, see management evaluations, or request a transfer somewhere else in the chain or to a new position.

 #### Portal
 You essentially become an all knowing being here when you are authenticated.

 Add hotels to the network as well as upload floorplans and set opening/operational dates. Approve hiring of new employees (which also creates their employee user account), manage promotions, set employee shifts, approve role changes and transfers. Manage/approve event contact requests, negotiate pricing with company/coorporation accounts. Create customer reports from their booking activity and send out targetted email campaigns to bring them back again.
